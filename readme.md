# Graph Viewer
This is an early version of a viewer and editor for node-and-edge graphs containing arbitrary data,
written using SDL2 and basic OpenGL.

Current features include:
- Adding nodes via ctrl-clicking empty space.
- Linking nodes via clicking them consecutively.
- Deleting nodes via shift-clicking.
- Saving and loading graphs to files.

Future plans include UI reworks, primarily to facilitate manipulating the data associated with the graph,
and scripting support.
